## Installation

- make sure you have VSCode and NodeJS on your machine

  - `REACT_APP_SERVER` will be the URL to where the server is running, e.g: http://localhost:5000
  - `REACT_APP_URL_UPLOAD_PAGE` will be the same above with new endings, e.g: http://localhost:5000/participant/upload
- open a console to where you put this application -> `npm i`
- run the server first
- after the server ran, from the console: `npm start`
